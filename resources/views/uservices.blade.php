                                few patients, characteristic of Treacher Collins Syndrome (TCS). TCS is a rare (1:50,000
                                occurrence in Europe) disease which is inherited in 40% of cases in an autosomal dominant
                                manner. Most patients have mutations in the TCOF1 (Treacle) gene, but more recently
                                mutations in the POLR1C, POLR1D and EFTUD2 genes have also been implicated. Most patients
                                have mutations in the TCOF1 gene, the protein product of which is involved in ribosome
                                assembly in the cell. Based on the clinical findings, we sought to confirm the clinical

                                team members came across a family with a young boy who had been clinically diagnosed with
                                Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS): a rare disease first described in 1964 at Johns Hopkins
                                University
                                in the US. LNS is a very rare condition which affects 1:380,000 live births in the US and
                                less than
                                10 patients have been described in India so far. It is an X-linked disease caused by
                                mutations in
                                the HPRT1 gene which results in deficiency of the hypoxanthine-guanine
                                phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) enzyme, which in turn leads to a buildup of uric acid in
                                all
                                organs of the body including in the blood and urine due to reduced purine utilization. The
                                disease is associated with severe gout, kidney problems and moderate intellectual
                                disability. A
                                defining feature of this syndrome is the tendency of the patient to self-mutilate. Thus far,
                                no
                                cure has been found for this condition, although many patients live to be adults. A genetic
                                confirmation of LHN was therefore required for this patient to rule out other syndromes with
                                some overlapping symptoms includingÂ idiopathic mental retardation, autism, Tourette
                                syndrome and Cornelia de Lange syndrome

                                <b>Methods and Expected Results:</b><br>
                                Clinical documentation and blood samples have been collected
                                from the 12 year old patient and his parents. DNA extracted from the samples will be
                                subjected
                                initially to PCR amplification of the 9 exons of the HPRT1 gene followed by Sanger
                                sequencing. If
                                no mutation is found in the coding region of the HPRT1 gene, other more intensive Next Gen
                                Sequencing protocols, WES and later WGS, will be used to identify the causative gene and
                                variant in this patient, and his mother. We have however discovered that the mother of the
                                patient has had elevated blood uric acid levels and has suffered pains for a long time.
                                Given
                                that LNS is an X-linked disorder, mild LNS symptoms in the mother could predict a mutation
                                in
                                the HPRT1 gene in both the mother (carrier) and in the patient. This possibility remains to
                                be
                                confirmed.

                                average 5.8g/dL). Besides anemia, his CBC was normal and his peripheral blood smear
                                indicated normocytic anemia. In addition the young patient presented with progressive
                                pallor and bowing of upper and lower extremities, mild splenomegaly but no hepatomegaly
                                or lymphadenopathy was observed. Radiologic findings indicated widening and thickening
                                of long bones, cortical thickening, coarse trabeculae and endosteal sclerosis. Bone marrow
                                examination revealed thickened bony trabeculae, fibrotic marrow spaces with entrapped
                                hematopoietic cells with a predominance of mononuclear cells. Since the diagnosis of this

                                prednisolone and discharged. Subsequently, a homozygous mutation in the TBXAS1 gene
                                was identified in this patient. While the child was born of non-consanguineous parents,

                                GHDD was first described by Ghoshal about three decades ago in Kolkata,
                                India where five patients were described with diaphyseal dysplasia and refractory anemia. It
                                has been described as a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the
                                TBXAS1 gene leading to deficiency of Thromboxane-A synthase which is involved in the
                                synthesis of Thromboxane A2. It has been suggested that decreased Thromboxane-A
                                synthetase leads to elevated levels of prostaglandin E2, which likely suppresses erythroid
                                precursors in the bone marrow, resulting in refractory anemia. GHDD patients have been
                                treated with blood transfusions and also with low-dose corticosteroids. While most patients
                                respond well to steroid treatment, it cannot be used in the long-term. Previous studies from
                                our team and others had shown that the amino acid L-Leucine alleviates both anemia and
                                developmental defects in a both humans and in a zebrafish model of another bone marrow
                                failure syndrome: Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA). Based on these studies, the patient was
                                put on a high Leucine diet
